# Smart Pension Code Test
## How to get started and run the app

1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm start`
    * Runs the app in the development mode.
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
4. Upload the `webserver.log` file included in the root of this repo.
5. Enjoy the results!


## Testing the app
* Is as simple as running `npm test`, which launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

## My experience of the test
Really interesting task for me. I had not used the File API before. It was a fun challenge to think through how to get the data into
a useable state and then how to process it. 

## Things to improve (with more time)
* Could look a lot prettier, no CSS added.
* Be able to sort by both ascending and descending order
* Have validation so only certain file types are accepted.
* More efficient algorithm for filtering and sorting data.
